# Q1:  Some prime numbers can be expressed as a sum of other consecutive prime numbers.
# For example
#   5 = 2 + 3,
#   17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7,
#   41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13.
# Your task is to find out how many prime numbers which satisfy this property are present in the range 3 to N subject to a constraint that summation should always start with number 2.
# Write code to find out the number of prime numbers that satisfy the above-mentioned property in a given range.
#   Input Format: First line contains a number N
#   Output Format: Print the total number of all such prime numbers which are less than or equal to N.
#   Constraints: 2<N<=12,000,000,000
