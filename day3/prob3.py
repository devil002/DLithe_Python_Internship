# Write a program to perform the following task.
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:
#   i. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
#   ii. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
#   iii. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

# Get input from user
print("Input")
num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())

# Calculate
# Sum of two digits
foo = num1 + num2
# Difference of two digits
diff = num1 - num2
# Product of two digits
pro = num1 * num2

# Output
print("Output")
print(str(foo))
print(str(diff))
print(str(pro))
